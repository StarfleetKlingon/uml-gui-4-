                    <h4>About Me: </h4>

                    <p>I attended nursing school for two years and worked as a certified nursing assistant for
                        an additional two before coming to UML for computer science. I currently work at New
                        England Rehabilitation Hospital up to 12 hours a week as needed.</p>

                    <p>Computer science goals include working in research, healthcare, or defense, and getting
                        a paper published. I would like to work in industry and get a Master's degree at night.</p>

                    <p>I plan to graduate in Winter 2016. </p>
